# UniversityFinder

This simple university finder app is just a console app that can search for any available university in the world.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the awesome app.
- Just clone this repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/Lemmah/UniversityFinder.git`
- Switch to project directory: `cd UniversityFinder`
- Install project requirements using python pip. But wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:

### Prerequisites

- Python3 and above
- Python virtual environment (not really, but is coming up)
Just type:
```
python -V
```
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to 3.5, you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.

### Installing

Now, you have python3 and a way of running a virtual environment. Lets set up the project environment.

1. Create your virtual environment. Usually, without any wrappers:
```
python -m venv my_venv
```
2. Start your virtual environment:
```
source my_venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the project requirements specified in the requirements.txt file. Usually,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This is enough to get you started.
**More instructions are coming up as the project advances**.

## Running the tests

## Deployment

No worry about deployment, you just run it on your console.
